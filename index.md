<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TIGHEDEV/GitHub-Administrator-Exam/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TIGHEDEV/GitHub-Administrator-Exam/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# GitHub Enterprise Revision guide

This revision guide is based off the content from the MS [Learn path:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/github-administration-products/) and content from the learning paths at the following [site:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/githubtraining/collections/mom7u1gzjdxw03)

## GitHub Administration

### Administration levels

1. Organisation
2. Teams - these can and should be nested
3. User

### Sync your GitHub team with your identity provider.

If using AzureAD, changes in AD will be reflected in GitHub.

### Organisation level administration

Organisation "owner" permissions allows you to do these activities:
- Invite and remove members from an organisation
- Place users into teams and grant "team maintaner" permissions to users
- Add or remover external collaborators
- Grant repository permission levels
- Set up organisation security
- Use customer scripts to get extra info from the repositories and apply migrations/organisation-wide changes.

## GitHub Authentication

### Authenitcation Options

1. Username and password
2. Personal Access Tokens
3. SSH Keys
4. Deploy Keys
5. MFA
6. SAML SSO (Security Assertion Markup Language)
7. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

## GitHub Permissions

### Repository Permissions

- **Read** For people who need to see the code but not interact with it
- **Triage** For people who proactively manage issyes amd pull requests but do not need write permissions
- **Write** For the standard developer and people who actively contribute to your project
- **Maintain** For project managers. Does not provide access to sensitive or destruvtive actions
- **Admin** For people who need full access to the project

Repository permissions can be be applied to organisation members, external collaborators and teams. 

### Team permissions

Permissions will cascade through teams that have child teams. Therefore you can apply repository permissions to a parent team that will benfit child teams of that parent. Make sure to only apply the right level of permissions to the parent team and then be more specific with child team permissions.

- **Member** Same set of abilites as organisation members
- **Maintainer** Is a team admin essentially. Abilities include: request team change parent and child teams; edit team discussions; and and remove members; give maintatner permission to other users; manage access to repositories; manage code review assignment and scheduled reminders for pull requests. An organisation owner can also prmote someone to become a maintainer. 

### Organisation Permissions

- **Owner** Can add or remove users to and from the organisation and do everything organisation members can do.
- **Member** Can create and manage organisation repositories and teams.
- **Billing Manager** Can only view and edit billing information.

You can set default permissions for all members of your organisation.

### Enterprise Permissions

- **Owner** The ultimate admin, can do everything!
- **Member** Same as an organisation member.
- **Billing Manager** Can only view billing information and add other billing managers.

![Pricing Comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73177811/167446586-cb001853-b4c5-42e3-9d92-bc87433e35db.png)

There are 3 different kinds of accounts for the GitHub products listed:
- Personal User Accounts
- Organisation Accounts
- Enterprise Accounts

### GitHub Actions licensing

- When running GitHub Actions, if you use a windows runner then you are charged double what the minutes are. 
- If you are using mac as your runner, you are charged 10x the number of minutes you actually consume. 
- Linux is 1 to 1. 
- You cannot roll over minutes each month.

### GitHub Packages Licensing

- Storage used is determined by the combination of Actions artifacts and packages. 
- Storage is calculated based on hourly usage for that month. For example, using 1GB a day for a week would be 1GB * 24hours * 7days then all divided by 744. 
- Storage is rounded up to the nearest MB. 
- Spending limits are default $0 so that you can't overspend unless you raise that limit.

### Codespaces Licensing

- Free to use whilst it is in preview. Normally would be charged for compute and storage.
- After 30 mins of inactivity, the codespace is suspended automatically.
- Compute costs are charged hourly. There will be 3 Linux instance types
  - Basic (2 cores, 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD)
  - Standard (4 cores, 8GB RAM, 32GB SSD)
  - Premium (8 cores, 16GB RAM, 32GB SSD)
- Storage costs are monthly until you delete the codespace. Cost is a small fee per GB used per month

## Managing GitHub Actions

This section will talk about how to manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise; understanding the diffrent features available for your accounts.

### Enterprise Level

- Create a **use policy** to prevent people from using dangerous third-party actions.
- You can choose whether the policy will apply to all your ogranisations or select organisations.
- You can choose which actions are allowed: if you want select actions then you can filter actions by actions that are created by GitHub or verified marketplace actions. You can also use a wildcard to specifi=y particular actions.

### Organisation Level

- Make best practices clear for users in your organisation. Provide users with the following best practices documented in a repo everyone has access to:
  - Repositories for storage
  - Files/folders naming conventions
  - Location of shared components
  - Plans fpr ongoing maintanence
  - Contribution guidelines
 - Create workflow templates
  - You must create a workflow template in the workflow-templates directory in a piblic .github repo.
  - There are 2 steps to create a template.
    1. Create a yml workflow file
    2. Create a json metadata file. This describes how the template should be presented to a user.
  - The file names must be the same, except for the metadata file it must end in properties.json instead of .yml
  - Users will be able to find the template you created under the workflows created by your organisation name section in the workflows tab.

### Manage Runners

- There are 2 types of runners: GitHub-hosted and Self-hosted runners
- Benefits of GitHub-hosted runners:
  - Automatic updates for the OS, preinstalled packages and tools, and self-hosted runner application
  - Managed and maintained by GitHub
  - Clean instance for every job execution
  - Use free minutes on your GitHub plan, then per-minute rates.
 - Benefits of Self-hosted runners:
  - Automatic updates for the self-hosted runner application only.
  - Can use hardware you've already paid for. Allows for customisable OS, software and security requirements.
  - Don't need to have a clean insance for every job
  - Free to use with GitHub Actions, but you are responsible for the cost of your hardware.
 - You can create self-hosted runner groups to apply rules to runners. For example, you can create a group that only containers runners that are allowed to deploy code to production and then only allow certain organisations access to this group.
 - Runners are added to the defauly group when created. They can only be in one group at a time.  
 - You can add custom labels to self-hosted runners. For example, adding a GPU label only to runners that have the correct GPU installed.
 - You must add IP allowlists in organisation settings if you use IP whitelisting and want to be able to use your self-hosted runners.
 - To troubleshoot your self-hosted runners there are a few things you can do
  - Check the status of the runner
  - Revview the activities and automatic updates of the runner in the Runner_ files in the _diag folder
  - Review the status of the runner executed in the Worker_ files in the _diag folder
 
 ### Manage Secrets
 
 Secrets are encrypted variables that you can use to store sensitive information
 
 - To access secrets in a workflow you need to use the **secrets** context before the secret name ```secrets.secret_name``` in the workflow file
 - To access secrets in an action you need to make the secret an **input parameter** in the action.yml metadata file.
 
 Organisation Level:
 
 - Secret can be used by anyone in that organisation
 
 Repository Level:
 
 - Secret can be scoped to just the specific repo.

## Maintaining a Secure GitHub Repo
   
### Best practices

 - To allow developers to report bugs privately you should establish a SECURITY.md file in the root of a repo to provide guidance to developers who identify bugs.
 - Use a **.gitignore** file to prevent files with sensitive information from being deployed. .gitignore files inherit their settings from parent directories so try to configure a .gitignore at a high level and then cascade down into the project.
 - **Branch protection rules** - can be used to ensure certain checks are always made when there is a deploymnent to a protected branch. Some uses include:
  - Run a build to check if the code changes can be built
  - Run a linter check for typos
  - Run automated tests
 - Add a **CODEOWNERS** file to your repo so that you can assign team members or entire teams to be required for any pull requests on changes to the path they are configured for.

### Automated Security

 - Detect and fix outdated dependancies. Can do this by viewing a **repo dependancy graph**.
  - GitHub scans common package manifests like your package.json or requirements.txt file and then shows all your dependancies visually
 - Automated dependancy alerts will alert you if you have dependancies which GitHub have detected having vulnerability risks
 - **Dependabot** creates pull requests to update dependancies to the recommended version
 - **Automated code scanning** can use CodeQL to query code to check for vulnerabilities
 - **Secret scanning** woll look for secrets or credentials that have been commited to your code. By default it happens on public repos and can be configured for private repos.
